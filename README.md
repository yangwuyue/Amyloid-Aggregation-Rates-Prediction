# Amyloid-Aggregation-Rates-Prediction

Note that Tenorflow and Keras need to be installed before running this program. See https://keras.io and https://www.tensorflow.org for the installation steps and documentation.It is necessary to install scikit-learn ï¼ˆhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable). Convenient for us to call other machine learning methods directly. 

The code contains the constructed Multiple-Layer Perceptron framework and other machine learning algorithms. Other machine learning algorithms include Multivariable Linear Regression,Support Vector Regression with linear kernel function, Support Vector Regression with polynomial kernel functions and Random Forest.
